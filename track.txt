basic syntax rules-1%
class definitions-2%
voltage data model(VDM) redefining components-3%
#

#
New components(Diode,Transistor,Ammeter Voltmeter,)-
#
diode done ✅-4%
logic gates(OR,AND,XOR,NOT) along with digital power done ✅-5%
But should redefine resistor logic to handle voltage drop and current in circuit
#
Make visual components and connect them with the classes-tough anyways use good library
